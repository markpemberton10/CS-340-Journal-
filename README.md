How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

In order to write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I focus on clear structure, separation of concerns, and consistent naming conventions. In this project, the CRUD Python module developed in Project One was designed as a standalone component responsible solely for database interactions. By isolating database logic from the dashboard code, the application became easier to maintain and debug, as changes to the database connection or queries could be made in one location without affecting the user interface. This approach also improved readability, since the dashboard code focuses on presentation and interaction logic rather than low-level database operations. An additional advantage of this design is adaptability. The same CRUD module can be reused in future applications, such as command-line tools, other dashboards, or automated reporting systems, without modification. If the database schema or credentials change, updates can be made within the module while preserving the rest of the application.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

When approaching a problem as a computer scientist, I begin by analyzing the requirements and breaking the problem into manageable components. For the Grazioso Salvare project, this involved identifying how the database, filtering logic, and dashboard widgets would interact to meet the client’s needs. I first ensured the database structure could support the required queries, then implemented the CRUD functionality, and finally connected the dashboard components using callbacks. This approach differed from previous assignments in other courses, which often focused on isolated coding tasks rather than an integrated, client-driven system. In this project, greater emphasis was placed on understanding user requirements, designing reusable components, and ensuring that the final product was intuitive and functional. In future projects, I would continue to use techniques such as modular design, iterative development, and early testing of database queries to ensure that systems meet client requirements efficiently and can be easily extended or modified.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists design, build, and maintain systems that solve real-world problems by transforming data into useful information. Their work matters because well-designed software systems can significantly improve efficiency, accuracy, and decision-making within an organization. In the case of Grazioso Salvare, this dashboard enables staff to quickly identify dogs that meet specific training criteria, reducing the time and effort required to manually review large datasets. By providing clear visualizations and intuitive filtering options, the application supports better operational decisions and helps the organization focus on its mission of training rescue animals. Projects like this demonstrate how computer science directly contributes to organizational effectiveness by delivering tools that are both technically sound and aligned with user needs.
